## 👥 Team (Group 8)

* **Sudhanshu Kadam** (Leader)
* **Sreeram Saravana Prasad** (Deputy Leader)
* **Arya Patil**
* **Vyshanth Buddani**
* **Ruchitha Jannu**

## 🎯 Motivation

The rise in AI-generated materials threatens the pillars of Information Assurance: **Integrity**, **authenticity**, and **non-repudiation**. In academic and professional domains, forged documents like essays, resumes, and certificates compromise reliable decision-making. Detecting such content restricts the malicious use of Generative AI, ensures fairness and authenticity in academic evaluation and professional recruitment, and preserves ethical standards.

    * Cryptographic watermarking
    * Stylometry
    * Metadata analysis
* Assess the detection of AI-generated images and text using emerging technologies, including:
    * CNN-based image forensics
    * Watermarking
    * Vision-based approaches
    * Feature-based detection
    * Adversarial learning
* Explore applications in academic plagiarism detection systems, applicant tracking systems (ATS), and HR verification platforms.
